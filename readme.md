## Electrified Monkey Haunt

Animatronic monkey for Halloween

Pics/video to come...

### The Setup

Paper mache monkey in a dog cage with (fake) jumper cables attached, etc.

Monkey has servo to move tail randomly.

Pebble watch used to trigger main action by connecting to http://<host>:3000/shock
(Install pebble.js on your Pebble via cloudpebble.net)

Uses applescript to trigger SFX (shocking sounds, monkey scream, etc).

Power Tail II used to switch power to drill with bent bit to shake cage.

Small strobe light modified to be triggered from pin.

### Notes

Please note: This is a last minute project, so the implementation is raw. Don't take anything I do here as "best practices". :)
